main_menu.php:
    1. There are two buttons in the ui: continue and levels.
    2. check if any record exists with a given user id from the "check_journey_started($user_id)".
    3. if the result from the above function is 0, dont show the continue button.
    4. else if the result > 0, show the continue button with the hyperlink as "play.php?group_id=*" 
    get the group_id from the function get_group_id($group_id, "ongoing")

levels_page.php:
    1. from the get_progress($user_id) function get the progress array.
    2. Arrange the Levels consisting of Skills consisting of Groups according to the status column of the resulting 
    array of objects.
    3. each group has a hyperlink as "play.php?group_id=*".
    4. the groups marked as "not started" should be disabled.

play.php:
    1. check for get string query group_id.
    2. when the page is loaded the make_ongoing($user_id, $group_id) is called to make the register in the 
    "learn_typing_progress" table.
    3. get the group contents from get_group_desc($group_id).
    4. display the contents properly and the functionality should be on javascript.
    5. in the input box check for keystrokes.
    6. As soon as "backspace" or "delete" is entered the group is failed and appropriate modal is displayed 
    to restart the level (which is essentially link to the same "play.php?group_id=*" page).
    7. If the complete "combinations" text is typed without using "backspace" or "delete" then appropriate modal is 
    displayed the function make_complete($user_id, $group_id) is called and it will return the next group id which will be 
    used in the next level link.
    8. If successfully completed the level and function make_complete($user_id, $group_id) returns null that means every
    level has been completed and appropriate message should be displayed.

all the db architecture is given in the changes.txt
learn_typing_progress: when a group is ongoing a record is created with a student_id, group_id and completed = 0. 
                       when a group is completed the record is updated with completed = 1

Levels -> Skills -> Groups -> alphabets, p_text, combinations
